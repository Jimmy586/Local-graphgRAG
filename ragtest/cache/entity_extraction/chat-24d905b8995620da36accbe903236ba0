Inspired by the visual cortex of animals, CNNs have become the cornerstone of computer vision applications due to their ability to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features. Introduced in the 1980s and popularized by LeCun et al. through the development of LeNet for digit recognition, CNNs have since evolved and expanded into various fields, achieving remarkable success in image classification, object detection, and segmentation tasks. The architecture of CNNs leverages convolutional layers to efficiently capture local patterns and features in data, making them highly effective for tasks involving high-dimensional inputs like images.\n\nArchitecture of Convolutional Neural Networks\nThe architecture of a typical Convolutional Neural Network consists of several key components: convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The convolutional layer is the core building block, where filters (or kernels) slide over the input data to produce feature maps. These filters are trained to recognize various patterns such as edges, textures, and shapes. Following convolutional layers, pooling layers (such as max pooling) are used to reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, thereby decreasing the computational load and controlling overfitting. The fully connected layers, typically at the end of the network, take the high-level filtered and pooled features and perform the final classification or regression task\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
